# Surface-Flattening-of-Polygonal-Meshes
Surface flattening of polygonal meshes with applications in medical image data

## Overview 
This work was inspired from the necessity to unfold of cardiac chambers, such as the left Atrium. It has several uses especially in scientific and clinical research. In clinical research, it has many potentially applications in analysing cardiac imaging data.
