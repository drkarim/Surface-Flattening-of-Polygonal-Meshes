# Surface-Flattening-of-Polygonal-Meshes
Surface flattening of polygonal meshes with applications in medical image data

## Overview 
This work was inspired from the necessity to unfold of cardiac chambers, such as the left Atrium. It has several uses especially in scientific and clinical research. In clinical research, it has many potentially applications in analysing cardiac imaging data.

## Templates
Templates are fixed surfaces which have been unfolded to a flat planar map. Some scientific communities such as the medical imaging community call these atlases. To construct these templates, numerous patient-specific examples are taken, transformed and registered to a common co-ordinate frame and fused to generate a *mean* shape.  

The concept of templates is important un unfold cardiac chambers at least. Cardiac chambers come in various different sizes and shapes. Registering and transfomring to a slightly unievrsal shape allows the unfold planar mapping to look the same. Planar mappings can start to look wildly different if they are directly derived from patient-specific examples.
